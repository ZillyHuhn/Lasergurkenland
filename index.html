            The hoster told me 200 gigabyte is too much and deleted the world.<br>
            <br>
            yikes.<br>
            <br>
            Before buying the server I asked about disk limits and they said there were none.<br>
            I was skeptic but I did not assume to end the journey at 200GB.<br>
            <br>
            Anyways the show must go on! So I bought a 2TB m2 SSD and slapped it into my professional home server (my gaming laptop lol).<br>
            <br>
            Seems like anarchy lgl survived the first big crisis and is up and running again.<br>
            No data was lost since the latest world version was still on my local drives.<br>

            Since 2020-11-16 the server was running temporarily on my laptop.<br>
            Sadly the ~290 gigabyte big world filled my drive completley. Since the issue was not detected right away the server run in this unstable state for a while.
            I hope it did not cause to big harm and did not corrupt any important files.<br><br>

            Anyways the server is now moving back to the cloud provider which causes some downtime.

            Nether and end backups are successfully restored. The server is up and running.<br>

            I sadly have to admit we have our first data loss.<br>
            Nether and end are being reset to the state of 2020-11-16 11:11.<br>
            Expected downtime due to restore is at least 12 hours

            Server is online again! Currently running on stronger local hardware.<br>
            So the ping might be slightly higher but the TPS should be better.<br>

            The paper spigot plan is canceld for now.<br>
            Lasergurkenland will stay vanilla.<br>
            The world backup and downtime is also cancled but will happen at some point.<br>

            There is some expected downtime in the next few days. <br>
            A world backup and switch to paper spigot is planned. <br>
            The server could stay down for multiple hours. <br>
